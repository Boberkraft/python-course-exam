This is a final test for high school students who attended 4 2-hour Python lessons.

It's meant for a 2 hour test at the end of the course.

After the test is complete, the teacher will read the student's code
and give each one an individual opinion regardin his/her programming
skills.

0 - I'm not sure if coding is for you.

1 - you have very basic coding skills. If you would like to work
as a programmer, you need to put more work into it.

2 - you have essential coding skills. You would likely get accepted
for a programming traineeship/apprenticeship.

3 - you are pretty fluent in coding. In my honest opinion you can
apply for an entry level programming job and get accepted.

It contains a script that will check results (grade.py).
